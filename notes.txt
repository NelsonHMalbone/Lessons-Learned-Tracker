Project Name: Lesson Learn Tracker

project started on 06-21-2025
project finished on TBD

1. so using chatgpt used it to make suggests of project ideas that are simular to a TO-DO List
some examples are Lesson Learn Log, Values and Alignment Tracker, Coping Skills and Self_reflaction
prompts

1.2 Following along with the Udemy Course Python Mega Course Module 1 is a To-Do list instead of doing
this i am going to change it to Lessons Learn Log.

1.3 How does this work:
    User will beable to add lessons learned from experiences
    user will beable to add a note to lesson if they want to
    User will beable to view all lessons
    Along with edit and delete as user understand and evolves

Starting the project
Section 1
    2. getting the user to beable to interact and getting the user to enter a input with the input() function

    2.1 user enters something but then it will disappear to be gone has no way to
        save data
            variable = input() the variable is like a box
            print and input are label as functions
            inside these functions are known as arguments
            can have 0 or more arguments
            functions can return a value
            text in python are strings
            can store strings in variables in project i have a example of both

    2.2
        Date 06-22-2025
        continuing getting user input
        with having varibles with a message is good and bad
            good because if you want to edit you can go there in change it, improves readablity of code
            bad adds more lines of code to project and more for computer to run

    2.2.1
        storing users input in a list
        [] is a python list
        print(type(variable)) shows the user the class of variable
        type() is consider a function in requires a argument

    2.3
        bonus example have a user enter a book title in getting the length of title.
        but we are going to do game titles instead

        first we build it then watch the vod. added a few f statements and a title() method to capitalize title.
        this was a simple appilication to make nothing to complex.

section 2
    1. starting section 2 of the course

    1.1 going to work on getting user input repeatedly
        using batch operation

            user1_input = input()
            user2_input = input()
            user3_input = input()
            not a setstainable way of getting multiple inputs.

            best way is using a while loop
                while 2 > 1 basic beginner way
                while is a function
                2 > 1 is a condition
                checking to s is 2 is greater then 1
                a True statement

                but the correct way is using
                while True:
