Project Name: Lesson Learn Tracker

project started on 06-21-2025
project finished on TBD

1. so using chatgpt used it to make suggests of project ideas that are simular to a TO-DO List
some examples are Lesson Learn Log, Values and Alignment Tracker, Coping Skills and Self_reflaction
prompts

1.2 Following along with the Udemy Course Python Mega Course Module 1 is a To-Do list instead of doing
this i am going to change it to Lessons Learn Log.

1.3 How does this work:
    User will beable to add lessons learned from experiences
    user will beable to add a note to lesson if they want to
    User will beable to view all lessons
    Along with edit and delete as user understand and evolves

Starting the project
2. getting the user to beable to interact and getting the user to enter a input with the input() function

2.1 user enters something but then it will disappear to be gone has no way to
    save data
        variable = input() the variable is like a box
        print and input are label as functions
        inside these functions are known as arguments
        can have 0 or more arguments
        functions can return a value
        text in python are strings
        can store strings in variables in project i have a example of both

2.2
    Date 06-22-2025
    continuing getting user input
    with having varibles with a message is good and bad
        good because if you want to edit you can go there in change it, improves readablity of code
        bad adds more lines of code to project and more for computer to run

2.2.1
    storing users input in a list
    [] is a python list
    print(type(variable)) shows the user the class of variable
    type() is consider a function in requires a argument
